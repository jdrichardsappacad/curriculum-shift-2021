## Quiz: Frontend Routing with React [TODO: EDIT]
- Q: How does the React Router determine which components to render?
  - Possible reword of answer? "It matches the `path` prop and the `component`
    prop to the url"
- This question appears twice - maybe we can point out that there is a
  `<Switch>` element in one of the questions (Q: Consider the above code. Given
  the above router, which component(s) would render when a user navigates to
  `/profile`?).
  - We should also edit the explanation for getting the question wrong!
