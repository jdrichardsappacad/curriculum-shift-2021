## Article: Babel

Notes:

- Very brief overview about babel
- Too brief to for students to gain any understanding (except in knowing which
  NPM packages to install)

# Babel [TODO: KEEP]

Add explanation what "transpiling" is so that students can know and briefly talk
about what Babel/Webpack does (I wasn't able to talk about transpilation).

## Configuring Babel for Web Apps [TODO: KEEP]

Add documentation resources

## Checking Compatibility [TODO: REMOVE]

Unsure how this section is relevant

## Article: React

Notes:

- We should definitely hammer the React life cycle methods here. We can briefly
  note how React Hooks will replace the life cycle methods, but full understand
  of the life cycle is important before learning the hot new Hooks.
- The TAs say that the hardest part of React is having people understand the
  life cycle methods.
- React docs component life cycle link:
  https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#the-component-lifecycle
- Component life-cycle diagram from React docs:
  http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/
- Can also be revised to discuss top React interview question topics.

Revision suggestions:

# React.js [TODO: KEEP]

Combine original "what is React" and "what isn't React" sections

## Why use React? [TODO: EDIT]

- Write about the pros of React
- Popular interview question to help students defend their choice in technology
  for their portfolio projects

## How does it work? [TODO: KEEP]

## Where does React come from? [TODO: DELETE]

- This is covered in `Article: NonTechnical Overview of React`

## Project: CSS Friends

- Includes skeleton
- Uses JQuery
- Teaches students about modals

## Project: Minesweeper

Notes:

- Students are asked to import a `minesweeper.js` library from a/A through a
  zipfile. We could connect this to how different companies sometimes create
  their own libraries to have reuseable code.
- As a student, I remember going through this project and feeling proud about
  rendering a UI but I feel like they should have another project before making
  minesweeper. Maybe a react application that connects with an external REST
  API?
- The instructions are a little confusing. Also, I think there should be some
  code snippets to guide the students.

Current Project Outline:

- Phase 0: Setup
  - Uses `npm init` (Should we use `create-react-app`?)
  - Students
- Phase 1: Game
- Phase 1a: React.render / Tile Stub
- Phase 2: Board
- Phase 3: Tile
- Phase 4: A Working Game
- Phase 5: Modal
