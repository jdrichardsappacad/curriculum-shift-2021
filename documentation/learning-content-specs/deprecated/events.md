# React & Events - 3 Days

**The objective of this lesson** is to get students comfortable with using React to handle different kinds of events.

**The criteria tests** for this lesson are:

1. Unit test driven guided coding problem for creating a component with a button that, when clicked, pops up an alert with the text: ‘you clicked me!’.
2. Unit test driven guided coding problem for creating a class based component called `TipCalculator`. The component should create a key value pair in the state object called ‘total’ and set it to 0. The component should render an editable text field that is set to the state of the component. When the field is changed it should set ‘total’ in the state. The component should also render an element that is not editable that displays the tip amount, 20% of the total.
3. Unit test driven guided coding problem for creating the TipCalculator component as a functional component using the useState hook to manage state updates.
4. Unit test driven guided coding problem for defining `proptypes` on a component with two strings and a number. Create a parent component called: ‘TroubleMaker’ that violates the established prop types and ‘PeaceMaker’ that observes the required prop types.


**This lesson is relevant** because knowing how to handle events in React is a necessity for anyone planning to work with it.

**Students will demonstrate competent performance** by completing a Unit test driven guided coding project using React.

**The deliberate practices** to pass the criteria tests are:
- *Reading*, *Video Coding Demo*, *Unit test driven guided coding problem* for creating a component with a button that, when clicked, pops up an alert with the text: ‘you clicked me!’ for #1.
- *Guided Project* covering criteria tests #2 & #3.
- *Reading*, *Video Coding Demo* for creating a class based component called `TipCalculator`. The component should create a key value pair in the state object called ‘total’ and set it to 0. The component should render an editable text field that is set to the state of the component. When the field is changed it should set ‘total’ in the state for #2.
- *Reading*, *Video Coding Demo* for creating the TipCalculator component as a functional component using the useState hook to manage state updates for #3.
- *Reading*, *Video Coding Demo* for defining `proptypes` on a component with two strings and a number. Create a parent component called: ‘TroubleMaker’ that violates the established prop types and ‘PeaceMaker’ that observes the required prop types for #4.
