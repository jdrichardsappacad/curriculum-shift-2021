# Front End Applications With React and Redux - 3 Days

**The objective of this lesson** is for students to get comfortable with
connecting React with Redux.

**The criteria tests** for this lesson are:

1. Unit test driven guided coding project for connecting React to Redux by using
   the `<Provider />` tag.
1. Unit test driven guided coding project for implementing a Container Component
   utilizing the connect function to pass data to a React component from the
   Redux store.
1. Unit test driven guided coding project for implementing a Container Component
   that utilizes `ownProps`.

**This lesson is relevant** because React and Redux are an incredibly popular
combination in the industry - making our students' knowledge of both that much
more appealing.

**Students will demonstrate competent performance** by being able to create a
frontend application that uses both React and Redux.

**The deliberate practices** to pass the criteria tests are:

- _Unit test driven guided coding project_ covering criteria tests #1-3.
- _Video Coding Demo_, _Reading_ for connecting React to Redux by using the
  `<Provider />` tag for #1.
- _Video Coding Demo_, _Reading_ for implementing a Container Component
  utilizing the connect function to pass data to a React component from the
  Redux store for #2.
- _Video Coding Demo_, _Reading_ for implementing a Container Component that
  utilizes `ownProps` for #3.
