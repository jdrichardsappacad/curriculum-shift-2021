# Redux Concepts - 0.5 Days

**The objective of this lesson** is for students to learn the main concepts
behind the boilerplate of the Redux cycle.

**The criteria tests** for this lesson are:

1. Verbal free response for summarizing the role of an action in the Redux
   cycle(changing the global state).
2. Verbal free response for paraphrasing the role of the Redux Store(holds the
   global state of your application).
3. Verbal free response for paraphrasing the role of Middleware in the Redux
   cycle, and give an example of one middleware (thunk, logger, etc.)
4. Label a diagram for when given a diagram of
   [Flux architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/img/flux-simple-f8-diagram-1300w.png),
   be able to fill in the blank for each section
5. Given a diagram of [the Redux cycle](https://blog.gisspan.com/img/redux.gif),
   be able to fill in the blanks for each section.
6. Multiple choice (select multiple) for identifying the three main design
   advantages of using Redux:
   - single source of truth(store)
   - state is read only
   - changes to global state are only made by pure functions(reducers)
7. Fill in the blank for when given a fill in the blank sentence with the
   description of a thunk, write in the correct answer.

**This lesson is relevant** because Redux is one of the most popular state
management libraries and our students will be more appealing as candidates if
they know Redux well.

**Students will demonstrate competent performance** by verbally explaining the
key concepts of the Redux cycle.

**The deliberate practices** to pass the criteria tests are:

- _Video Lecture_, _Reading_, _Verbal free response_ for for summarizing the
  role of an action in the Redux cycle(changing the global state) for #1.
- _Video Lecture_, _Reading_, _Verbal free response_ for paraphrasing the role
  of the Redux Store(holds the global state of your application) for #2.
- _Video Lecture_, _Reading_, _Verbal free response_ for paraphrasing the role
  of Middleware in the Redux cycle, and give an example of one middleware
  (thunk, logger, etc.) for #3.
- _Video Lecture_, _Diagramming_, _Label a Diagram_ for when given a diagram of
  [Flux architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/img/flux-simple-f8-diagram-1300w.png),
  be able to fill in the blank for each section for #4.
- _Video Lecture_, _Diagramming_, _Label a Diagram_ for when given
  [the Redux cycle](https://blog.gisspan.com/img/redux.gif), be able to fill in
  the blanks for each section for #5.
- _Multiple choice (select multiple)_, _Video Lecture_, _Reading_ for
  identifying the three main design advantages of using Redux for #6.
- _Video Lecture_, _Reading_, _Fill in the Blank_ for when given a fill in the
  blank sentence with the description of a thunk, write in the correct answer
  for #7.
