# Redux Reducers and Action Creators - 1 Day

**The objective of this lesson** is for students to become comfortable enough
with coding out the Redux cycle that they can do it from memory.

**The criteria tests** for this lesson are:

1. Unit test driven guided coding project for when given a fully functioning
   backend, demonstrate the ability to set up the Redux boilerplate without
   given documentation.
2. Unit test driven guided coding project for implementing a Reducer which
   accepts two arguments: the store and an action. This function must return a
   new object representing that individual slice of state.
3. Unit test driven guided coding project for implementing a RootReducer, a pure
   function that will take in at least one other reducer and uses the
   combineReducers function.
4. Unit test driven guided coding project for implementing a store using the
   previously defined RootReducer as well as the middleware package for the
   Redux thunk.
5. Unit test driven guided coding project for creating Action Creators that will
   accept data and return POJOs with a type.
6. Unit test driven guided coding project for creating Thunk Action Creators
   that will make API calls, receive the dispatch function from the thunk, and
   will then invoke the previously defined Action Creators.

**This lesson is relevant** because Redux is one of the most popular state
management libraries and our students will be more appealing as candidates if
they know Redux well.

**Students will demonstrate competent performance** by completing the Redux
cycle for a Unit test driven guided coding project.

**The deliberate practices** to pass the criteria tests are:

- _Unit test driven guided coding project_ for criteria tests #1-6.
- _Video Coding Demo_, _Reading_ for when given a fully functioning backend,
  demonstrate the ability to set up the Redux boilerplate without given
  documentation for #1.
- _Video Coding Demo_, _Reading_ for implementing a Reducer which accepts two
  arguments: the store and an action. This function must return a new object
  representing that individual slice of state for #2.
- _Video Coding Demo_, _Reading_ for implementing a RootReducer, a pure function
  that will take in at least one other reducer and uses the combineReducers
  function for #3.
- _Video Coding Demo_, _Reading_ for implementing a store using the previously
  defined RootReducer as well as the middleware package for the Redux thunk for
  #4.
- _Video Coding Demo_, _Reading_ for creating Action Creators that will accept
  data and return POJOs with a type for #5.
- _Video Coding Demo_, _Reading_ for creating Thunk Action Creators that will
  make API calls, receive the dispatch function from the thunk, and will then
  invoke the previously defined Action Creators for #6.
