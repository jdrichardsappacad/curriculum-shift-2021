# Intro to React - 2 days

**The objective of this lesson** is to give students an introduction to the main concepts of React.

**The criteria tests** for this lesson are:

1. Unit test driven guided coding problem for when given documentation on `React.createElement` API, decompose an element defined in JSX into pure JS using `React.createElement`.
2. Verbal free response for defining the React DOM as contrasted with the browser’s actual DOM.
3. Unit test driven guided coding problem for writing a functional component that receives a name string argument and creates an h1 that greets the name. Using JSX to set name to ‘Rose’ and render the component to the page.
4. Unit test driven guided coding problem for writing a component that receives an array of food names as props and creates an unordered list with list items for each of the foods. Render this to the page.
5. Label a diagram for when given a screenshot of FaceBook, design a component hierarchy.
6. Verbal free response for summarizing the history of the creation of React and its purpose.

**This lesson is relevant** because React is one of the most popular JS frontend libraries and in order to develop a solid understanding of React a thorough introduction is needed.

**Students will demonstrate competent performance** by paraphrasing React's main ideas and utilizing React to solve a Unit test driven guided coding project.

**The deliberate practices** to pass the criteria tests are:
- *Reading*, *Video Coding Demo*, *Unit test driven guided coding problem* for when given documentation on `React.createElement` API, decompose an element defined in JSX into pure JS using `React.createElement` for #1.
- *Reading*, *Video Lecture*, *Flash Cards*, *Verbal free response* for defining the React DOM as contrasted with the browser’s actual DOM for #2.
- *Reading*, *Video Lecture*, *Video Coding Demo*, *Unit test driven guided coding problem* for writing a functional component that receives a name string argument and creates an h1 that greets the name. Using JSX to set name to ‘Rose’ and render the component to the page for #3.
- *Reading*, *Video Coding Demo*,*Unit test driven guided coding problem* for writing a component that receives an array of food names as props and creates an unordered list with list items for each of the foods. Render this to the page for #4.
- *Reading*, *Video Lecture*, *Label a diagram* for when given a screenshot of FaceBook, design a component hierarchy for #5.
- *Flash Cards*, *Verbal Free Response* for summarizing the history of the creation of React and its purpose for #6.
