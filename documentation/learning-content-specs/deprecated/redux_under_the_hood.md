# Redux Under the Hood - 2 Days

**The objective of this lesson** is to be able to identify some of the more
complex concepts of the Redux cycle.

**The criteria tests** for this lesson are:

1. Multiple choice (single right answer) for explaining what the `Object.freeze`
   function does and why it is used in reducers.
2. Multiple choice (single right answer) for when given an arrow function with
   an implicit return, show how to debug that function (make an explicit
   return).
3. Multiple choice (select multiple) for identifying the getter and setter
   methods for the Redux Store (dispatch and getState).
4. Multiple choice (single right answer) for when given multiple choices,
   identify why a reducer must always return a new object when making a change
   to the original given state.
5. Multiple choice (single right answer) for when given multiple choices,
   identify the role of a reducer in the Redux cycle.
6. Multiple choice (single right answer) for when given multiple choices,
   identify the role of a selector in the Redux cycle.

**This lesson is relevant** because being able to talk about all angles of Redux
will make students stronger in interviews.

**Students will demonstrate competent performance** by being able to pass a quiz
covering the above topics.

**The deliberate practices** to pass the criteria tests are:

- _Multiple choice (single right answer)_, _Reading_ for explaining what the
  `Object.freeze` function does and why it is used in reducers for #1.
- _Multiple choice (single right answer)_, _Video Coding Demo_ for when given an
  arrow function with an implicit return, show how to debug that function (make
  an explicit return) for #2.
- _Multiple choice (select multiple)_, _Reading_ for identifying the getter and
  setter methods for the Redux Store (dispatch and getState) for #3.
- _Multiple choice (single right answer)_, _Video Lecture_, _Reading_ for when
  given multiple choices, identify why a reducer must always return a new object
  when making a change to the original given state for #4.
- _Multiple choice (single right answer)_, _Video Lecture_, _Reading_ for when
  given multiple choices, identify the role of a reducer in the Redux cycle for
  #5.
- _Multiple choice (single right answer)_, _Video Lecture_, _Reading_ for when
  given multiple choices, identify the role of a selector in the Redux cycle for
  #6.
